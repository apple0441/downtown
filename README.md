# About this project

This is a non-profit project.
The portal is an open-source project that was created in collaboration with the Shopware community to help local retailers in this trying time.

It allows local governments, cities, or similar authorities to give local merchants an easy way of
keeping in touch with their customers and selling goods and services online.

After installing the project on a web server, local authorities can register within the portal.

After registration and activation by the portal owner, a sub-portal will be automatically created for each local authority.
After this step, local retailers can register within their local authority's sub-portal.
Next, customers can register and interact with retailers in their area.

## Goal

At the time this project is created, the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) pandemic
has a serious impact on the economy. Since retail stores are forced to close, they now need new solutions to generate
an income.

The portal project is trying to help. It is created to serve the project [downtowns.io](https://downtowns.io/), but since
it is open source anyone is able to set up a a web server and provide the same service as downtowns to their local community. 

## How it works

A picture is worth a thousand words, so here are some example screen designs of the portal. The text is in german,
since the portal was initially developed for the german market.

After the registration, the organisation has to be activated by the portal owner. Then these steps follow:


- An organisation (e.g. a city) registers within the portal
- Organisations are created as a sales channel
- Retail stores register within the organisation, internally they are handled as categories
- Retail stores can use an App to upload products
- Users (buyers) can browse retail stores and see whatâ€™s in stock
 
This is how the landing page for an organisation or local authority looks:

And here is an example of a retailer's landing page:
